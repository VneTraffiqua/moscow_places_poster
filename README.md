## Environment variables

Part of the project settings is taken from the environment variables. To define them, create a `.env` file next to `manage.py` and write data there in the following format: `VARIABLE=value`.

There are 3 variables available:
- `DEBUG` - debug mode. Set to `True` to see debug information in case of an error.
- `SECRET_KEY` â€” project secret key
-  `STATIC_URL` - path to static files
